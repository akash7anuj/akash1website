# My First Web Page 🌐

This is my first web page built using **HTML and CSS** to experiment with design and layout. The page doesn't contain any specific content, but it showcases **visual elements and styling** to create a structured and appealing design.

## Features:
✅ Basic HTML structure  
✅ Styled using CSS for a visually appealing layout  
✅ Responsive and well-structured design  

This project serves as a foundation for future web development projects. 🚀
